              <p>
                I am engineering student and doing my btech in computer science
                and engineering with specialisation in machine learning. I love
                coding and loves to play with different technologies. I believe
                that technology is something which is one of the core part of
                our life in today's era and we can't imagine our life without
                it. So my aim is to help other people by making my contribution
                in this field, so that I can give little contribution from my
                side by serving other people.

            <h3>Hello! i'm Rohit Rana.</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              An inspiring Software Engineer wishing to get more knowledge about
              the tech field. Inclines towards the field of programming and have
              knowledge in programming languages like c++, c, python, frontend
              web development, javascript. I am also passionate about exploring
              new and exciting things. My hobby is reading books as I believe
              that if you are not upgrading yourself daily then automatically
              you got degraded. I am also part of an NGO named Koshish family
              where we used to teach underprivileged children and give a little
              contribution from our side to make these children empowered and
              better citizens of our country. Apart from this I have some
              knowledge of marketing too and have invested a good amount of time
              in this field where I have learned qualities like leadership,
              courage, risk-taker, humanity, productivity, communication e.t.c I
              am keen interested in learning new technology because I believe
              that if technology is being used in the right way then it has
              great power to add so many good values in our's as well as others'
              life.

                Teaching is one of my best hobby which I love to do in my spare
                time. I love to interact with kids. Teaching is not only about
                teaching someone, but it also learning at the same time. It is
                two way process. Teaching is something from where I have learned
                how to deliver content to other's so that it becomes crystal
                clear to them. Teaching is something which teaches you how to
                become a responsible person of the society and contribute to the
                nation by sharing good knowledge with others.

                I also love to read self help books in my free time. I think it
                is the best utilization of our spare time. Because when we are
                reading book than not only we are reading books and getting
                knowledge but also getting the many years of experience of the
                book author. Till now I have read more than 25 books, some of my
                favourite books which I have read Till now are "The Compound
                Effect", "Ikigai", "Habits", "Steve Jobs", "Autobiography of the
                Yogi" e.t.c

                I also invest some part of my life to one our ngo named "Koshish

                teach them but also try to make them the best citizen of our
                country. It is something which is very close to my heart and it
                calms me so much from inside whenever I got chance to meet these
                lovely kids and bring happiness in their face

                I love to spend my time in doing physical exercise. I atleast
                devote half an hour doing physical exercise. Because I believe
                that it should be first priority, because if we don't devote our
                time in doing exercise daily.Then we may loss our health and may
                have lot of health issues. So this is something which I love so
                much to do. Beside it I also do meditation for atleast 10-15
                minutes so that I become physically and mentally fit
